# Penguins Capstone Project: NHL Forward Performance Analysis

**Carnegie Mellon University — Summer 2024**
**In collaboration with the Pittsburgh Penguins R&D Team**

## Overview

This capstone project developed consistency and performance metrics for 200+ NHL forwards using advanced statistical methods, including PCA-weighted z-scores, clustering analysis, and Random Forest modeling. The work was conducted in partnership with the Pittsburgh Penguins R&D team, whose guidance and approval shaped our analytical approach.

## Team

- **Mirriam Chisunta (Chikwamu)** — Statistical modeling, exploratory analysis, and metric development
- - **Celine Su** — Repository management, primary coding, and analysis
  - - **Cole Shegan** — Analysis and modeling contributions

      ## Important Note on This Repository

      This repository contains the **preliminary, individual analyses** that each team member conducted independently before we converged on a unified approach. Each folder represents a team member's exploratory work — testing different methods, visualizations, and statistical techniques as we determined the best path forward.

      The **final, consolidated codebase** lives in a single shared file that we developed collaboratively, working interchangeably on one computer. That final product reflects the combined efforts of all three team members and was built with the direct input and approval of the Pittsburgh Penguins R&D team.

      ## Methods & Tools

      - **Languages:** R, Python
      - - **Techniques:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-Means Clustering, Random Forest, ARIMA, Weighted Mean Change metrics
        - - **Visualization:** RShiny interactive dashboard, ggplot2
          - - **Data:** NHL player statistics for 200+ forwards
           
            - ## Key Outcomes
           
            - - Developed novel Weighted Mean Change metrics for evaluating player consistency
              - - Built predictive models (Random Forest R² = 0.90) outperforming traditional ARIMA approaches
                - - Created an interactive RShiny dashboard for non-technical stakeholders
                  - - Presented findings at the **CMU Summer Showcase** and the **Academic Data Science Alliance Conference** in Ann Arbor, MI
